# Natours - Advanced CSS Course

This repository contains my work from following the **Advanced CSS and Sass** course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann).

## Course Context

This is a personal project I built while taking the course. All the code in this repository is based on the course content and exercises from the course.

I am not the original creator of the course material. This is just my implementation of the course's lessons, built to help me learn more about advanced CSS techniques.
